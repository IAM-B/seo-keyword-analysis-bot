# SEO Keyword Analysis Bot

This repository contains a bot designed to automate the analysis of keywords for SEO, particularly to build a list of high-potential keywords for niche blog title creation. By leveraging Googleâ€™s `allintitle` search feature, the bot identifies keywords with strong SEO potential, helping content creators target phrases that are more likely to rank well in search engines.

## Objective

The bot aims to create a list of keywords with high SEO value, ideal for crafting titles in niche blogs. By filtering keywords based on search volume, competition level, and relevance, this tool provides valuable insights to optimize content strategy and improve search visibility.

## Features

- **Keyword Collection**: Fetches keywords from a `keywords.csv` file, expected to be exported from **Google Ads Keyword Planner**.
- **Search Volume and Competition Analysis**: Uses Google search to check the `allintitle` count for each keyword, identifying phrases with less competition.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Filters keywords based on predefined monthly average thresholds and quality indices, saving sorted results to `final_sorted.csv` for easy reference.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Selenium** (for automated browsing)
- **Google Chrome** and **ChromeDriver** (for Selenium)
- **Pytest** (for running tests)
